     <p>I’m Cuong Nguyen, a cybersecurity professional with over 10 years of experience in offensive operations. As a red team operator at an investment management firm, I simulate threat actor TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) to strengthen organizational defenses through rigorous red team exercises.</p>
    <p>Through CN Security Consulting Pty Ltd, I deliver expert offensive security services—penetration testing, adversary simulation, malware development, offensive phishing operations, and WiFi exploitation—to protect businesses from evolving cyber threats. Whether you need custom malware to test your detection systems or a WiFi security assessment, I can enhance your security posture with tailored offensive strategies.</p>
    <p>I take pride in delivering high-quality work, all performed locally in Melbourne, Australia, without third-party involvement. This ensures you receive top-tier service directly from me. I hold OSCP, OSWP, and OSWA certifications from Offensive Security, a globally recognized leader in cybersecurity training and certification.</p>
