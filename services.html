            <h3>pentest</h3>
            <p>Penetration testing is a proactive service where we simulate real-world cyberattacks to identify vulnerabilities in your infrastructure, systems, and applications. We assess the security of your systems before attackers can exploit them.</p>
            <p><strong>Options:</strong> One-off deep dive (3-day breach) or continuous intrusion retainer</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> <a href="/contact">run contact.exe</a> for custom breach assessment</p>

            <h3>malware</h3>
            <p>The malware development service tests the effectiveness of your security systems by creating custom malware designed to evade detection. This helps strengthen your defenses by identifying gaps in your detection and mitigation capabilities.</p>
            <p><strong>Options:</strong> Single payload deployment or recurring threat simulations</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> <a href="/contact">run contact.exe</a> for system stress test</p>

            <h3>wifi</h3>
            <p>The WiFi exploitation service assesses your organisation’s wireless network security by simulating advanced attacker techniques. Using cutting-edge tools and methodologies, I conduct targeted attacks—such as rogue access point deployment, traffic interception, and credential harvesting—to expose vulnerabilities in your WiFi infrastructure, encryption, and user behavior. This service helps you strengthen defenses against real-world wireless threats.</p>
            <p><strong>Options:</strong> One-time wireless breach assessment</p>
            <p><strong>Access:</strong> <a href="/contact">run contact.exe</a> for network lockdown</p>
